# MR Pinky's Tuk-Tuk Tours - Website
My Name Is Visut, But You Can Call Me Mr. Pinky. I've Been A Tour Guide In Siem Reap For About 10 Years And I Know The Area And It's History Well. I Speak English To High Level And I Work Closely, When Needed, With A Fully Qualified Professional Guide If You Want To Know More Information About Angkor And It's Surrounding Temples Than You Could Could Possible Take In In One Day. MY Tours Are Fun And I Provide A New Bike With A Comfortable Trailer, An Ice-Box With Ice-Cold Water And Beer Provided For My Clients All Day Long.

I Have Many Options For You To Consider As Your Tour, Or You Can Tell Me What YOU Want To Do, After All, It's YOUR Holiday Or Special Occasion.

There's So Much To Do In Siem Reap, And Whether You Want To Plan Your Day/S Or You Would Like Me To Suggest, I Will Help You Create Some Memories That You Will Never Forget!
